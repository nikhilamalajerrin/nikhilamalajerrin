**nikhilamalajerrin/nikhilamalajerrin** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on effective engineering solutions for the better future. I have a bachelors in Mechatronics and a strong background knowledge in Robotics,Embedded systems and Artificial Intelligence. Getting a life changing product into the hands of people is my calling
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ROS and MOTION PLANNING
- 👯 I have Profound knowledge in Control theory, SLAM, Path planning, Motion Planning, ROS framework, Embedded system Design and Mechanical Designing. Proficient in Simulation         software : V-REP,Matlab and Gazebo with good Programming skills in C, C++ and Python.
- 💬 Ask me about Robotics,kinematics,dynamics and control theory
- 📫 How to reach me: nikhilamalajerrin.mc17@bitsathy.ac.in
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not working I'm likely to hear music, yelling at athletes on TV who can't hear me,reading anything I can find on Steve Jobs and Muhammad Ali and I go by the motto “Character consists of what you do on the third and fourth tries"
